## Lecture & Lab
Tues/Thur 11:45-13:00  
All lecture content will be outlined in [Lectures](Lectures/).

"Lab" time is Mon 16:40-17:40 at the [Chesterfield Design Suite
(5704)](chesterfield_design_suite.md).  In general, this time is allocated as
protected project time for your team to utilize to collectively meet, meet with
your TAs and clinical advisors, and will also be utilized for guest lectures
and prototyping skill development sessions.

## Course Overview & Outcomes
The introduction of formal engineering design principles will be emphasized.
Students are expected to identify and research a need drawn from Duke
hospital/medical personnel, local companies and organizations around Duke
University. Students will develop and determine design feasibility for a
device, system, material, or process, subject to real-world constraints such
as time, money, and resources. Students should also be able to communicate
objectives in writing and presentations.

Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:
1. Successfully develop a prototype to solve a client-based design challenge
through following engineering design steps: 
  + Define clientâ€™s need/space
  + Investigate current designs/challenges and solutions
  + Generate design criteria
  + Brainstorm solutions for your client
  + Evaluate and prioritize ideas via matrix selection
  + Prototype and build physical solution
1. Work collaboratively on an engineering team to complete design project.
1. Work collaboratively on an engineering team to write technical documents
and present oral/visual technical reports.
1. Work safely in space allotted.

## Prerequisites
* BME271 (Signals & Systems)
* BME354L (Introduction to Medical Instrumentation)
* These courses, or equivalents, may be taken a corequistes.

## Course Objectives
* Statement of project goals
* Introduction, background, and market research
* Development of sound design specifications
* Functional decomposition, concept generation and concept selection
* Proof of feasibility (identification of evaluative testing)
* First round prototype

## Attendance and Participation
Lecture attendance and participation is important because you will be working
in groups most of the semester.  Participation in in-class activities and in 
out-of-class team activities will count for 15\% of your class grade.  
It is very understandable that students will have to miss class for job interviews, 
personal reasons, illness, etc.  Absences will be considered \emph{excused} if they are
communicated to Drs. Palmeri and Richardson at least 48 hours in advance (subject
to instructor discretion as an excused absence) or, for illness, through
submission of a [Short Term Illness Form
(STIF)](http://www.pratt.duke.edu/undergrad/policies/3531) **before** class.
Unexcused absences will count against the participation component of your class
grade.

## Textbooks & Resources
There are no required textbooks for this class.  A variety of online resources
will be referenced throughout the semester.  

## Grading
The course GitHub repository will host all [Assignments](Assignments/).
Due dates--including those that change--will be announced in lecture and by
Sakai announcements that will be emailed to the
class.  

The following grading scheme is subject to change as the semester progresses:
<table>
<tr>
<td>Participation</td>
<td>15%</td>
</tr>
  
<tr>
<td>Midterm project (Cycle 1) prototyping/skills deliverables </td>
<td>15%</td>
</tr>
  
<tr>
<td>Midterm project (Cycle 1) documentation deliverables </td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Final project (Cycle 2) prototyping/skills deliverables </td>
<td>20%</td>
</tr>
  
<tr>
<td>Final project (Cycle 2) documentation deliverables </td>
<td>15%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Oral presentations (Both Cycle 1 and 2)</td>
<td>25%</td>
</tr>

</table>

## Class Schedule
The course schedule is very likely to change depending on progress throughout
the semester.  The updated [schedule](schedule.md) will always be available in
the GitHub course repository.  

## Duke Community Standard & Academic Honor
Engineering is inherently a collaborative field, and in this class, you are
encouraged to work collaboratively on your projects.  The work that you submit
must be the product of your and your group's effort and understanding.  All
resources developed by another person or company, and used in your project,
must be properly recognized.

All students are expected to adhere to all principles of the [Duke Community
Standard](http://www.integrity.duke.edu/standard.html).  Violations of the Duke
Community Standard will be referred immediately to the Office of Student
Conduct.  Please do not hesitate to talk with your instructors about any
situations involving academic honor, especially if it is ambiguous what should
be done.
