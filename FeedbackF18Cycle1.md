# Cycle 1 Feedback

*We are listening!*

## Going Well
* Overall positive sentiment that students are learning about the design
  process.

* Process of populating the content for the documentation is very useful
  (creating the documentation takes a good deal of time).

* Good experience in team building and project management.

## Needs Improvement
* Tough to meet documentation deadlines when projects remain undefined
  (specifically for the disability projects).

* Lectures were geared towards medical devices and not clear how that relates
  to disability projects.

* Not enough prototyping skills to date.

* Light project a diversion / distraction from main project.

* Confusion about What to do next on main projects?  
  + Unclear expectations for what to have by end of first semester.
  + Where do we even start?!

## Remediation Plans
* More details added to remaining class [schedule](schedule.md).

* Prototyping skills were delayed to accommodate delay in some projects getting
  defined; ramping up exponentially starting **now**.

* Light project is meant to be a "sandbox" to practice these skills; not a
  distraction.

* Individual team meetings with Drs. Palmeri and Richardson will guide main
  project next steps, with lots of guidance on how to execute on the
  prototypes.
