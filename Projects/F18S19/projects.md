## Endofy
### Clinical Sponsor
Dr. David Leiman, M.D. (Department of Gastroenterology)

### Problem Statement
Diagnostic and therapeutic flexible gastrointestinal endoscopy is made possible
by through-the-scope working tools. These tools exit the working channel in a
single orientation (traditionally parallel to the lumen and/or straight ahead),
which potentially limits their utility. Articulating devices such as biopsy
forceps or polypectomy snares would substantially increase the degree of
freedom with which challenging interventions are performed.

## Ignis
### Clinical Sponsor
Dr. Ana Ceclia Rodriguez, M.D.

### Problem Statement
Small-volume medical waste incineration.

### Team

## Carpal Diem
### Clinical Sponsor
Dr. Marc Richard, M.D. (Department of Surgery)

### Problem Statement
The measurement of the small joints of the fingers/hand/wrist is tedious and is
currently done by a manual process using a handheld goniometer.  There is
significant opportunity to make this process faster, more accurate, and more
reproducible.  This project seeks to create a device that through image capture
technology can ease the process and in turn, improve patient care.  The
exportable data will be easily uploaded into electronic medical records or
research files offering significant benefit to clinicians as well.
