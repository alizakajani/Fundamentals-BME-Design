# Potential Future Projects

## Surgery (Suresh)

Wound healing (dynamic pressure)         

## Pneumonics (Ken Bernstein, CEO)

Consumer product to monitor respiratory depression.

## Lloyd Technologies (Dr. Ralph Lloyd, Ph.D.)

Novel dissinfection technologies.

## MicroElastic Ultrasound Systems (Dr. Peter Hollender, Ph.D.)

Skin device coupling.

## Surgery / Respiratory Therapy (Dr. Harrison Jones, Ph.D.)

1. Development of algorithm to extract 1 sec average maximum
inspiratory/expiratory pressure from 3-4 second trial
2. RMT monitor-Connect to Bluetooth and app for control and feedback
3. Tongue trainer-comfort of placement in oral opening including size, ability
to adjust the “plunger” more intraorally for some patients with greater
weakness or ROM limitations, increased range of resistance 0-30 newtons
including a much better design for adjusting this
4. Further development of use of butterfly valve as resistance mechanism for
inspiratory/expiratory resistance for respiratory training
5. Modeling and testing of respiratory pressure curves from MIP/MEP testing to
develop algorithms to select good vs bad efforts (ie, duration of effort,
acceleration to peak pressure)

## Surgery (Dr. Suresh Agarwal, M.D.)

Chest tube placement and maintained placement / patency.

## Design Ethnography (Sponsor TBD)

Development of a VR system for design ethnography and medical training.
