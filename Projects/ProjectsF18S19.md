# Medical Device Projects (Fall 2018 / Spring 2019)

## Pneumonics (Ken Bernstein, CEO)

Consumer product to monitor respiratory depression.

## Lloyd Technologies (Dr. Ralph Lloyd, Ph.D.)

Novel dissinfection technologies.

## Surgery / Urologic Oncology (Dr. Ali Amin Sharifi, M.D.)

Laparoscopic needle detector system for localization of retrieving a lost
needle in the abdomen.

## Surgery / Respiratory Therapy (Dr. Harrison Jones, Ph.D.)

1. Development of algorithm to extract 1 sec average maximum
inspiratory/expiratory pressure from 3-4 second trial
2. RMT monitor-Connect to Bluetooth and app for control and feedback
3. Tongue trainer-comfort of placement in oral opening including size,
ability to adjust the “plunger” more intraorally for some patients with
greater weakness or ROM limitations, increased range of resistance 0-30
newtons including a much better design for adjusting this
4. Further development of use of butterfly valve as resistance mechanism for
inspiratory/expiratory resistance for respiratory training
5. Modeling and testing of respiratory pressure curves from MIP/MEP testing
to develop algorithms to select good vs bad efforts (ie, duration of effort,
acceleration to peak pressure)

## Anesthesiology (Dr. Ian Welsby, M.D.)

Low-cost, combined suction/visualization intubation device for OR, ED,
military, & EMT applications.

## Cardiology (Dr. Muath Bishawi, M.D.)

Improved, non-invasive blood pressure monitor for use at home.

## Anesthesiology (Dr. Stuart Grant, M.D.)

Improved depth of anesthesia monitor using muscle stimulation.

## Gastroenterology (Dr. Andrew Muir, M.D.)

Improvement of endoscopy ergonomics.

## Gastroenterology (David Leiman, M.D.)

Endoscope biopsy device.

## Surgery / Urologic Oncology (Dr. Ali Amin Sharifi, M.D.)

Noninvasive medical system to measure the length of intramural ureter in
children.

## Neonatology (Dr. David Tanaka, M.D.)

Pediatric transport vibration and noise monitor.
