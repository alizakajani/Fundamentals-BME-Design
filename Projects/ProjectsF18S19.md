# Medical Device Projects (Fall 2018 / Spring 2019)

## Surgery / Urologic Oncology (Dr. Ali Amin Sharifi, M.D.)

Laparoscopic needle detector system for localization of retrieving a lost
needle in the abdomen.

## Surgery / Urologic Oncology (Dr. Ali Amin Sharifi, M.D.)

Measurement system to measure the length of the ureter (bladder) / prostate.

## Anesthesiology (Dr. Ian Welsby, M.D.)

Low-cost, combined suction/visualization intubation device for OR, ED,
military, & EMT applications.

## Cardiology (Dr. Muath Bishawi, M.D.)

Improved, non-invasive blood pressure monitor for use at home.

## Neonatology (Dr. David Tanaka, M.D.)

Pediatric transport vibration and noise monitor.

## GI Surgery (Dr. David Leiman, M.D.)

Diagnostic and therapeutic flexible gastrointestinal endoscopy is made possible
by through-the-scope working tools. These tools exit the working channel in a
single orientation (traditionally parallel to the lumen and/or straight ahead),
which potentially limits their utility. Articulating devices such as biopsy
forceps or polypectomy snares would substantially increase the degree of
freedom with which challenging interventions are performed. 

## Global Health (Dr. Ana Ceclia Rodriguez, M.D.)

Small-volume medical waste incineration.

## Hand Surgery (Dr. Marc Richard, M.D.)

The measurement of the small joints of the fingers/hand/wrist is tedious and is
currently done by a manual process using a handheld goniometer.  There is
significant opportunity to make this process faster, more accurate, and more
reproducible.  This project seeks to create a device that through image capture
technology can ease the process and in turn, improve patient care.  The
exportable data will be easily uploaded into electronic medical records or
research files offering significant benefit to clinicians as well.

## Dermatology (Dr. Carlos Eduardo, M.D.)

Mobile body scanning platfrom to track skin lesion evolution.
