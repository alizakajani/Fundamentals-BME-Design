# Medical Device Projects (Fall 2018 / Spring 2019)

## Pneumonics (Ken Bernstein, CEO)

Consumer product to monitor respiratory depression.

## Lloyd Technologies (Dr. Ralph Lloyd, Ph.D.)

Novel dissinfection technologies.

## Surgery / Urologic Oncology (Dr. Ali Amin Sharifi, M.D.)

Laparoscopic needle detector system for localization of retrieving a lost
needle in the abdomen.

## Surgery / Respiratory Therapy (Dr. Harrison Jones, Ph.D.)

1. Development of algorithm to extract 1 sec average maximum
inspiratory/expiratory pressure from 3-4 second trial
2. RMT monitor-Connect to Bluetooth and app for control and feedback
3. Tongue trainer-comfort of placement in oral opening including size,
ability to adjust the “plunger” more intraorally for some patients with
greater weakness or ROM limitations, increased range of resistance 0-30
newtons including a much better design for adjusting this
4. Further development of use of butterfly valve as resistance mechanism for
inspiratory/expiratory resistance for respiratory training
5. Modeling and testing of respiratory pressure curves from MIP/MEP testing
to develop algorithms to select good vs bad efforts (ie, duration of effort,
acceleration to peak pressure)

## Anesthesiology (Dr. Ian Welsby, M.D.)

Low-cost, combined suction/visualization intubation device for OR, ED,
military, & EMT applications.

## Cardiology (Dr. Muath Bishawi, M.D.)

Improved, non-invasive blood pressure monitor for use at home.

## Anesthesiology (Dr. Stuart Grant, M.D.)

Improved depth of anesthesia monitor using muscle stimulation.

## Gastroenterology (Dr. Andrew Muir, M.D.)

Improvement of endoscopy ergonomics.

## Surgery / Urologic Oncology (Dr. Ali Amin Sharifi, M.D.)

Noninvasive medical system to measure the length of intramural ureter in
children.

## Neonatology (Dr. David Tanaka, M.D.)

Pediatric transport vibration and noise monitor.

## MicroElastic Ultrasound Systems (Dr. Peter Hollender, Ph.D.)

Skin device coupling.

## Surgery (Dr. Suresh Agrawal, M.D.)

Chest tube placement and maintained placement / patency.

## GI Surgery (Dr. David Leiman, M.D.)

Novel articulation of endoscopic surgical tools.

## Global Health (Dr. Ana Ceclia Rodriguez, M.D.)

Small-volume medical waste incineration.

## Hand Surgery (Dr. Marc Richard, M.D.)

The measurement of the small joints of the fingers/hand/wrist is tedious and is currently done by a manual process using a handheld goniometer.  There is significant opportunity to make this process faster, more accurate, and more reproducible.  This project seeks to create a device that through image capture technology can ease the process and in turn, improve patient care.  The exportable data will be easily uploaded into electronic medical records or research files offering significant benefit to clinicians as well.

## Dermatology (Dr. Carlos Eduardo, M.D.)

Mobile body scanning platfrom to track skin lesion evolution.

## Design Ethnography (Sponsor TBD)

Development of a VR system for design ethnography and medical training.
